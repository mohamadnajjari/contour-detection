# Image Contour Analysis and Line Detection
This Python repository demonstrates a simple yet powerful image processing technique for contour analysis and line detection using the OpenCV library. The script fetches an image from a URL, applies Sobel edge detection, adaptive thresholding, and contour analysis to identify and classify regions in the image.
# Key Features:
Edge Detection: Sobel operators are utilized to compute the vertical and horizontal edges in the grayscale version of the image.
Adaptive Thresholding: The script applies adaptive thresholding to enhance the visibility of edges and facilitate contour extraction.
Contour Analysis: Contours are identified and filtered based on their area to isolate regions of interest.
Line Detection: Each identified region is further analyzed for line-like structures, and the regions are marked accordingly.
Visualization: The final result is displayed using OpenCV, showcasing the original image with marked regions and lines.
