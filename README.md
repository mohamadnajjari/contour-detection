# contour-detection
This Python repository demonstrates a simple yet powerful image processing technique for contour analysis and line detection using the OpenCV library. The script fetches an image from a URL, applies Sobel edge detection, adaptive thresholding, and contour analysis to identify and classify regions in the image.
