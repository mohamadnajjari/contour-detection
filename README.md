# Image Contour Analysis and Line Detection
This Python repository demonstrates a simple yet powerful image processing technique for contour analysis and line detection using the OpenCV library. The script fetches an image from a URL, applies Sobel edge detection, adaptive thresholding, and contour analysis to identify and classify regions in the image.
## Key Features:
### Edge Detection: 
Sobel operators are utilized to compute the vertical and horizontal edges in the grayscale version of the image.
### Adaptive Thresholding:
The script applies adaptive thresholding to enhance the visibility of edges and facilitate contour extraction.
### Contour Analysis: 
Contours are identified and filtered based on their area to isolate regions of interest.
### Line Detection: 
Each identified region is further analyzed for line-like structures, and the regions are marked accordingly.
### Visualization: 
The final result is displayed using OpenCV, showcasing the original image with marked regions and lines.
## Dependencies:
requests: For fetching the image from a URL.
PIL: For working with images and byte streams.
cv2 (OpenCV): Used for image processing, contour analysis, and visualization.
numpy: Required for numerical operations on image data.
## Usage:
1) Ensure the required dependencies are installed (requests, PIL, cv2, numpy).
2) Copy and run the provided script, replacing the image URL as needed.
3) Observe the output window displaying the original image with highlighted regions and lines.

Feel free to explore and modify the script for your specific use cases, such as image analysis, object detection, or further customization of the contour filtering criteria.
